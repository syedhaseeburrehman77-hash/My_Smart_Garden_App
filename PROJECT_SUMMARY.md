# 🌱 Smart Garden App - Complete Project Summary

## 📋 Overview

This is a complete, production-ready Smart Garden App built with Streamlit that uses AI and weather APIs to help users care for their plants **without requiring any physical sensors**. The app intelligently combines weather data, user input, and AI to provide smart plant care recommendations.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Garden Dashboard (Screen 1)**
✅ **Real-time Weather Display**
- Shows current temperature, conditions, humidity, cloud cover
- Displays sunrise/sunset times
- Weather icon from OpenWeatherMap

✅ **Plant Status Cards**
- Each plant shows:
  - Current watering status (Needs Water / Happy)
  - Sun exposure estimate
  - Care recommendations
  - Placement and sun preference info

✅ **Smart Alerts**
- 🌧️ **Rain Alerts**: Warns when rain is expected (with time estimate)
- ⚠️ **Storm Alerts**: Critical warnings for thunderstorms/hail
- ☀️ **Heat Alerts**: Warnings when temperature >35°C

### 2. **Add a Plant (Screen 2)**
✅ **AI Plant Identification**
- Upload photo → Gemini Vision API identifies the plant
- Returns: Common name, scientific name, description, care level

✅ **Manual Plant Entry**
- Form with all required fields:
  - Plant name (auto-filled from AI)
  - Placement: Open Roof / Balcony / Indoor Window
  - Sun preference: Morning Sun / Afternoon Shade / Full Sun
  - Watering interval (days)
  - Location (city)
  - Notes

✅ **Image Storage**
- Plant photos saved locally in `plant_images/` folder

### 3. **AI Botanist Chat (Screen 3)**
✅ **Plant Care Q&A**
- Chat interface powered by Gemini
- Context-aware (considers user's plants and weather)
- Natural language responses

✅ **Health Diagnosis**
- Upload plant photo for AI analysis
- Identifies issues: yellow leaves, brown spots, pests, etc.
- Provides step-by-step recommendations

## 🧠 Smart "No-Sensor" Features

### Feature A: Virtual Sun Sensor ✅
**How it works:**
1. Gets cloud cover % from OpenWeatherMap API
2. Gets sunrise/sunset times
3. Combines with user input (placement + sun preference)
4. Calculates actual sun exposure

**Logic:**
- Clear sky (<20% clouds) + Open Roof + Daytime = Very High exposure
- High clouds (>50%) = Low exposure
- Temperature >35°C + High sun = Heat risk warning

**Output:** 
- Estimated exposure level
- Recommendations (e.g., "High heat and intense sun! Consider moving to shade")

### Feature B: Smart Water Reminder ✅
**How it works:**
1. Each plant has base watering interval (e.g., 3 days)
2. Checks weather data:
   - Recent rain? → Reset timer
   - Rain expected soon? → Pause notification
   - Temperature >35°C? → Reduce interval by 1 day
   - Temperature <15°C? → Increase interval by 1 day

**Logic Flow:**
```
IF recent_rain:
    → No water needed
ELIF rain_expected_soon:
    → Wait for rain
ELIF days_since_watered >= adjusted_interval:
    → Needs water (with urgency level)
ELSE:
    → Happy, show days until next watering
```

**Output:**
- Status message (e.g., "💧 Needs water! It's been 4 days")
- Urgency level (high/medium/low)
- Days since last watered

### Feature C: Shelter Alert ✅
**How it works:**
1. Checks weather forecast for next 24 hours
2. Looks for severe conditions: thunderstorm, storm, hail
3. If plant is marked as "Outdoor" → Alert user

**Logic:**
```
IF storm_detected AND plant.placement IN ["Open Roof", "Balcony", "Outdoor"]:
    → Generate urgent alert with Gemini
    → Show time until storm (e.g., "2 hours")
```

**Output:**
- AI-generated friendly alert message
- Time estimate until severe weather
- Recommendation to move indoors

## 📊 Data Flow (Workflow)

### Adding a Plant:
```
User uploads photo

Gemini Vision API identifies plant
    ↓
User fills form (placement, sun, watering interval)
    ↓
Data saved to plants_database.json
    ↓
Appears on Dashboard
```

### Daily Check (8:00 AM):
```
App loads Dashboard
    ↓
Weather Service: Get current weather + forecast
    ↓
For each plant:
    ├─ Calculate watering status (with weather adjustments)
    ├─ Estimate sun exposure
    ├─ Check for rain/storm alerts
    └─ Generate recommendations
    ↓
Display on Dashboard with alerts
```

### User Interaction:
```
User asks question in AI Botanist
    ↓
Gemini Chat API (with context: plants + weather)
    ↓
Returns helpful advice
    ↓
Saved to chat_history.json
```
